					  <p>Ashadha Gupta Navaratri is dedicated to the worship of Varahi Devi. We call this Varahi Navaratri too. Varahi Devi is the Army Chief of Lalita Devi. She is the inherent Shakti of Adi Varaha Swamy. Worshipping her will save is from Land disputes and court issues. She gives fortune in the form of Bhoomi (land, property, agriculture, etc.). The Goddess saves you from health issues and protects you always. On Ashadha Shukla Navami day which falls on June 27th, the Purohits will perform Varahi Homa in the Shaktipeetha Kshetra of Srisailam. The Seva happens in an ashram located in the Kshetra. You can participate in the Homa and attain the grace of the Goddess during the Navaratri. The Pandits will chant you Gotra-naamas in the Sankalpa and ensure that you receive the blessings and benefits of the Homa. You can watch the Seva live on youtube. The links and timings will be shared with you through SMS/WhatsApp. Upon completing the Seva, Prasadam containing Akshatas, Kumkum, blouse piece, Raksha thread and an edible item will be sent to your address.</p>
